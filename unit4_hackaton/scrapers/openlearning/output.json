Leveraging on the internet, the content of the course can now be provided typically on an online learning platform and the students are expected to study the materials prior coming to the classroom. The classroom can now be transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment where the teacher facilitates and guides students as they explore/apply concepts and engage creatively in the subject matter.</p>\n<p>Flipped classroom is designed to empower students to become <strong>self-directed learners</strong>, allowing them to construct their own learning and create their own meaning. Designed and executed properly, Flipped classroom could be the key to a <strong>total classroom makeover</strong>.</p>\n<p>This short course will demonstrate my own approach to flipping the classroom, changing the way we teach and the way students learn.
